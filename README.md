# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This is the Bootcamp week 1 challenge project which consist of refactoring the codebase of the landing page of the company Horiseon in order to improve their web accessibility and SEO performance.

![Landing page mock-up](./docs/Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

My solution included semantic tags to organise the HTML document in the header, main and footer sections, and organise the main content as follows:

* content, listing the content in semantic sections,
* benefits, listing the content in semantic asides.

Lastly, I added metadata tags and fixed broken links for SEO and browser performance purposes.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Once you have opened the `index.html` in your preferred browser, you should see a page that looks like as the image below:

![How the landing page should look like](./docs/Assets/01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

Essentially, the new page should look the same as the previous version because it just include semantic meta data for browsers and search bots to understand better the content. 

You can open the inpector tool in your browser to check the HTML and CSS structure of the landing page.
